You assignment is to fork this repository, clone your fork locally and complete a test first implementation of the following problem using RSpec as the testing library. Your GitHub repository will be the focus of our grading:

Prime Number Detector:
1. The class is not initialized with anything special. You call a method "prime_number?" that will tell you if the number is a prime number or not. 
2. A prime number is  a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 
3. 2, 3,5,7,11,13,17,19 are all examples of prime numbers 

Some things we will look for:
* A properly specified version of RSpec in your Gemfile
* Good sized commits and descriptive commit messages
* Good looking code. Bonus points if you show some refactorings

Feedback we will collect:
* Your self assessment of your performance submitted to yourself via the feedback tool in students.gschool.it
* Feedback from your neighbor in the form of GitHub comments
* Feedback from the instructors in the form of GitHub comments
